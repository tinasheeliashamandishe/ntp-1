<h1>NTP </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab will show how NTP works.<br/><br />

NTP is the  Network Time Protocol. It's a networking protocol used to synchronize the clocks of computers or other devices on a network. NTP allows devices to coordinate their time settings with a high degree of accuracy, ensuring that they all have the same time reference. This is crucial for many networked applications, such as distributed systems, where accurate timekeeping is essential for proper operation.
